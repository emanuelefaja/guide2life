# Non-Communicable Diseases.
> “Prevention is better than cure." **Desiderius Erasmus.**


Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are medical conditions that are not transmissible from person to person. NCDs are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 74% of all deaths worldwide [1].

So it’s important that you understand NCDs, as they are likely to you or the people around you. 

These diseases are typically long-lasting and progress slowly over time, resulting in a long painful death and also severe distress for family members and loved ones .

The four main types of NCDs are:

1. **Cardiovascular diseases**: Conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks and stroke.
2. **Cancers**: Diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body.
3. **Chronic respiratory diseases**: Conditions affecting the lungs and airways, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. **Diabetes**: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.


## **Why NCDs Matter**
NCDs not only affect your own quality of life but also have significant economic impacts on families, communities, and healthcare systems. Contrary to popular belief, NCDs are not just a problem for wealthy, developed countries; they disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, where over three-quarters of global NCD deaths occur.

NCDs also eat up the majority of healthcare dollars. For instance, in the US it is 90% of the healthcare budget[2] and in the EU is is 80%[3]. This is growing and clearly not sustainable.

Given the substantial financial burden that NCDs place on healthcare systems and societies, it can be argued that looking after your health is not only a personal responsibility but also a civic duty. By adopting healthy lifestyles and reducing the risk of developing NCDs, you contribute to the sustainability of healthcare systems and the overall well-being of your community.

## Your responsibility. 
> “Our health is a result of our choices every day." **Moira Hutchison.**

While genetic factors do play a role in the likelihood of you developing an NCD, lifestyle choices and habits — _the things that you control_ — are the primary drivers of these diseases. 

The main modifiable risk factors for NCDs include:

1. **Unhealthy diet:** Diets high in saturated and trans fats, added sugars, and salt can increase the risk of NCDs.
2. **Physical inactivity:** Insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior are linked to increased risk of NCDs.
3. **Tobacco:** Smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke are major risk factors for NCDs, particularly cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases.
4. **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of NCDs, including liver disease and some types of cancer.

_These are all under your control_, and so you can significantly reduce your risk of developing NCDs. 

A compelling example of how lifestyle factors can dramatically impact NCD risk is the study of the Tsimane people in Bolivia. [4] The Tsimane follow a traditional lifestyle of hunting, gathering, fishing, and farming, with high levels of physical activity and a diet low in saturated fats and high in fiber. 

Despite a high infectious disease burden, the Tsimane have extremely low rates of coronary artery disease, with CT scans showing that 85% of Tsimane adults had no evidence of coronary artery calcification — the lowest reported levels of coronary artery disease of any population recorded to date. This study suggests that a lifestyle characterized by high physical activity, a healthy diet, and minimal smoking and alcohol consumption can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, even in the presence of other health challenges.

## Deep Dive into main NCDs.

### Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) affect the heart and blood vessels, and are the leading cause of death worldwide [5]. The most common types of CVDs include coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and hypertension. Coronary heart disease occurs when the blood vessels supplying the heart become narrowed or blocked, leading to heart attacks and angina. Strokes happen when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump blood effectively, leading to shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and feet. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure.

### Cancers
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Some of the most common types of cancer include lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and skin cancer. Lung cancer is often caused by smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke and air pollution. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, while prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, affecting the prostate gland. Colorectal cancer affects the colon and rectum and is often associated with a diet high in processed and red meats. Skin cancer is caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.

### Chronic Respiratory Diseases

Chronic respiratory diseases affect the lungs and airways, with the most common types being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and occupational lung diseases. COPD is a group of diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. Asthma is a chronic condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Occupational lung diseases are caused by exposure to dust, fumes, or other irritants in the workplace, such as silicosis and asbestosis.

### Diabetes
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component, in which the body does not produce insulin, requiring daily insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough insulin, and is often associated with obesity and physical inactivity. If not properly managed, diabetes can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputation.
