# Alcohol.

Alcohol is a poison, and one of the most widely consumed recreational substances on the planet. Even *surprisingly* low alcohol consumption has negative impact on the brain and body. 

That said, drinking clearly has an appeal, otherwise not so many people would do it. 

> Because no great story ever started with someone eating a salad.

This part of Guide2Life is designed to help you understand alcohol and its affects on your health. Then you can make an informed decision if you want to drink alcohol. 

Ask yourself: how does alcohol fit into my life and health goals?

You may decide that the [social benefits of alcohol](#why-drink-alcohol) are worth the health downsides, especially when you drink in moderation. 

Guide2Life is not here to tell you precisely how to live, we purely provide information so you can make the best decisions possible using evidence-based reasoning. 

**However, it is clear in the data and studies that large and regular consumption of alcohol (i.e. "binge drinking") is incompatible with living a good life.**  



## What is Alcohol?

Let's start at the start — what, *precisely*, is alcohol?

The alcohol found in drinks such as beer, wine, and spirits is *ethanol*,  a psychoactive substance.

> [!TIP] 🧠 What is a Psychoactive Substance?
> A psychoactive substance is a chemical that affects brain function, altering perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Examples include alcohol, caffeine, and illicit drugs like cocaine and LSD.

It's produced through fermentation — when yeast eats sugar, one of the byproducts is alcohol.

At a chemical level, ethanol consists of two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom:  

$$C_2H_5OH$$


Alcohol is a depressant that slows down brain function and impairs coordination. However, during the first few drinks, alcohol's effect on the brain's reward system can create a temporary "buzz," causing increased energy and lowered inhibitions. As drinking continues, the depressant effects become more noticeable, leading to slurred speech, impaired judgment, and slowed reactions.

### Brief History 

The exact date of alcohol discovery is uncertain, but evidence suggests it has been produced and consumed by humans for thousands of years. Some of the earliest known evidence of alcohol consumption dates back to around 7000 to 6600 BCE in China, where residues of a fermented rice, honey, and fruit beverage were found in pottery jars from the Neolithic village of Jiahu.

In ancient Egypt, beer and wine were important components of religious ceremonies and were also used for medicinal purposes. The Egyptians believed that beer was invented by the god Osiris, and it was a staple drink among the working class.

The ancient Greeks and Romans also had a significant role in the development and spread of alcohol production. They worshipped Dionysus (Greeks) or Bacchus (Romans), the god of wine, and held festivals in his honor. The Romans played a crucial role in spreading wine production techniques throughout their vast empire.

During the Middle Ages, monasteries became centers for beer and wine production in Europe. Monks would often brew beer as a means of providing safe drinking water to the local population, as the alcohol content helped kill harmful bacteria.

The distillation of alcohol, which concentrates its potency, is believed to have originated in the Middle East or China, with early records of distillation dating back to the 12th century. The technique spread to Europe in the 13th century and gave rise to spirits such as whiskey, gin, and vodka.

::: details Famous Drinkers in History

- **Ernest Hemingway:** The celebrated American author was known for his heavy drinking, which he often incorporated into his writing. He famously said, "Write drunk, edit sober."
- **Winston Churchill:** The British Prime Minister was known for his love of whiskey and champagne. He reportedly drank throughout the day, but managed to maintain his productivity and leadership.
- **Edgar Allan Poe:** The renowned writer battled alcohol addiction throughout his life, which some believe contributed to his untimely death at age 40.
- **Vincent van Gogh:** The Dutch post-impressionist painter struggled with mental health issues and alcoholism. His heavy drinking was thought to have exacerbated his psychological problems.
- **Charles Bukowski:** The American writer and poet was famous for his gritty, realistic depictions of life on the margins of society, often fueled by his excessive alcohol consumption.
- **Janis Joplin:** The rock and roll icon struggled with drug and alcohol addiction throughout her short life, ultimately leading to her death by heroin overdose at age 27.
- **Jack Kerouac:** The celebrated Beat Generation author, famous for his novel "On the Road," had a tumultuous relationship with alcohol that contributed to his declining health and death at age 47.
- **Stephen King:** The prolific horror author struggled with alcohol and drug addiction early in his career, but managed to overcome his substance abuse issues and maintain his successful writing career.
- **Alexander the Great:** The ancient Macedonian king, renowned for his military conquests, was also known for his excessive drinking and sometimes violent behavior when under the influence.

### Units of Alcohol
A unit of alcohol is a standardized measure used to quantify the amount of pure alcohol in a drink. The concept of a "unit" of alcohol was introduced by the British government as a means of promoting responsible drinking and providing clear guidelines for alcohol consumption.

In the UK, one unit of alcohol is defined as 10 milliliters (ml) or 8 grams of pure alcohol. Other countries have other definitions, but they broadly align. 

This is roughly equivalent to:

- A single shot (25 ml) of spirits (40% alcohol by volume).
- Half a pint (about 285 ml) of regular strength beer (around 4% alcohol by volume).
- A small glass (125 ml) of wine (around 12% alcohol by volume).

You can see a list of common drink formats and their equivalent units below:

## How Alcohol Works

Alcohol is water and fat-soluble, allowing it to easily enter all cells and tissues in the body. When ingested, it is converted to the toxic substance *acetaldehyde* before being metabolized into *acetate*.

Once alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream, it quickly travels throughout the body, affecting various organs and systems. The liver is the primary organ responsible for metabolizing alcohol, but it can only process a limited amount at a time. On average, the liver can metabolize about one standard drink per hour. When alcohol consumption exceeds this rate, the excess alcohol continues to circulate in the bloodstream, leading to intoxication.

Alcohol's effects on the brain are particularly significant. It interferes with the brain's communication pathways, disrupting the delicate balance of neurotransmitters. Initially, alcohol enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces brain activity, leading to feelings of relaxation and lowered inhibitions. Simultaneously, it inhibits glutamate, a neurotransmitter that stimulates brain activity. As alcohol consumption continues, it triggers the release of dopamine, creating feelings of pleasure and reward. However, as blood alcohol levels rise, the depressant effects become more prominent, causing slurred speech, impaired coordination, and slowed reaction times.

Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to long-term changes in brain structure and function. Over time, the brain adapts to the presence of alcohol, developing tolerance and requiring larger amounts to achieve the desired effects. This can lead to alcohol dependence and addiction. 

Long-term alcohol abuse can also cause damage to brain cells and lead to neurological problems such as memory loss, cognitive impairment, and an increased risk of dementia. Additionally, alcohol's effects on other organs, such as the liver, heart, and pancreas, can indirectly impact brain function by causing systemic health problems that affect the entire body.

Each daily drink (10-12 g alcohol) is associated with a 4-13% increase in breast cancer risk in women, likely due to effects on estrogen.

Alcohol kills beneficial gut bacteria and increases inflammation in the gut-liver-brain axis. This gut disruption is one factor that leads to cravings for more alcohol.

Ingesting alcohol, even in small amounts, increases cortisol release and stress when not drinking. This can lower the threshold for anxiety between drinking episodes.

In the context of this podcast, "chronic alcohol intake at low levels" refers to regular, habitual drinking of smaller amounts of alcohol. This is in contrast to binge drinking or heavy alcohol consumption.

Dr. Huberman defines this low-level chronic drinking as consuming on average 1-2 drinks per day, or 7-14 drinks per week. This might look like:

1. Having one drink with dinner each night
2. Having 2-3 drinks every Friday and Saturday night
3. Drinking 3-4 drinks in one sitting once a week

While these drinking patterns may not lead to obvious intoxication or acute alcohol-related problems, they still qualify as chronic alcohol intake. The key here is the regularity and consistency of alcohol consumption over time, even if the amount consumed per occasion is relatively low.

The podcast emphasizes that even this level of habitual drinking can lead to negative effects like changes in brain structure, increased impulsivity, and disrupted mood regulation. This challenges the common belief that only heavy drinking is harmful, and suggests that regular consumption of alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can have cumulative effects on health and behavior over time.

- Disruption of sleep architecture: Even small amounts of alcohol can interfere with the quality of sleep by disrupting REM and deep sleep stages, leading to less restorative sleep.
- Increased cancer risk: Alcohol is a known carcinogen, and regular consumption is associated with an increased risk of various cancers, particularly breast cancer in women. Each additional 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day (roughly one drink) is associated with a 4-13% increase in breast cancer risk.
- Gut microbiome disruption: Alcohol can kill beneficial gut bacteria and lead to intestinal inflammation and "leaky gut." This, in turn, can contribute to a range of health problems and may exacerbate alcohol cravings.
- Hormonal imbalances: Alcohol can interfere with hormone production and balance. In males, it can lead to increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen, potentially causing issues like gynecomastia (breast tissue growth) and decreased libido.
- Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration: Chronic alcohol use can trigger inflammation in the brain and contribute to the deterioration of brain cells and structures, accelerating cognitive decline.
- Weakened immune system: Alcohol can impair the body's immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections and diseases.
- Increased risk of accidents and injuries: Alcohol impairs judgment, coordination, and reaction time, increasing the likelihood of accidents, falls, and other injuries.
- Social and psychological consequences: Alcohol misuse can contribute to or worsen mental health issues like depression and anxiety, strain interpersonal relationships, and lead to social and occupational problems.
- Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a range of developmental disabilities and birth defects known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).
- - Liver disease: Long-term alcohol use can lead to a range of liver problems, including fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. These conditions can impair liver function and, in severe cases, lead to liver failure.
- Pancreatitis: Alcohol is a leading cause of pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas that can become chronic and lead to serious complications.
- Heart disease: While some studies suggest that light to moderate drinking may have cardioprotective effects, heavy drinking can contribute to high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle), and an increased risk of stroke and heart failure.
- Digestive problems: In addition to its effects on the gut microbiome, alcohol can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, leading to issues like gastritis, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Sexual dysfunction: Chronic alcohol use can contribute to sexual problems in both men and women, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and difficulty achieving orgasm.
- Osteoporosis: Alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium and vitamin D, which are essential for maintaining strong bones. Over time, this can lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.
- Cognitive impairment and dementia: While the podcast mentions neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, it's worth noting that chronic heavy drinking is a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
- Medication interactions: Alcohol can interact with many prescription and over-the-counter medications, altering their effectiveness or causing dangerous side effects.
- Nutritional deficiencies: Alcohol can interfere with the absorption and metabolism of essential nutrients, leading to deficiencies that can impact various aspects of health.

## Types of Drinking

### Chronic Drinking

Chronic drinking is defined as consuming alcohol regularly and consistently over an extended period, even if the amount consumed per occasion is relatively low.

>[!DANGER]⛔️ Even moderate drinking is harmful
>This definition challenges the common belief that only heavy binge drinking is harmful and suggests that regular consumption of alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can have cumulative effects on health and behavior over time.

More specifically,]  chronic drinking is charactertized as consuming on average 1-2 drinks per day, or 7-14 drinks per week. This pattern of drinking might manifest in various ways, such as:

1. Having one drink with dinner each night
2. Having 2-3 drinks every Friday and Saturday night
3. Drinking 4-5 drinks in one sitting once a week and one other lighter drinking session

It's important to note that while these drinking patterns may not lead to obvious intoxication or acute alcohol-related problems, they still qualify as chronic alcohol intake due to the regularity and consistency of consumption over time.

Even this level of habitual drinking can lead to negative health consequences, such as:

- Changes in brain structure and function
- Increased impulsivity and decreased cognitive control
- Disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms
- Altered stress response and mood regulation
- Increased cancer risk and other long-term health problems

### Binge Drinking
> Drinking heavily, you abandon people, and they abandon you and you abandon yourself. It's a form of partial self-murder' **Jack Kerouac.** [^amburn]
### Alcoholism

Alcoholism is also known as AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder).

It's when someone can't stop or control their drinking despite negative impacts on their social life, work, and health.

AUD progressively worsens, ranging from occasional binge drinking to the need for alcohol daily from morning to night. The worst cases are where an alcoholic has a drink at breakfast.

 It affects more than just the stereotypical "down-and-out" individual on the streets.  Globally, around 5.1% of the population aged 15 and over is estimated to suffer from AUD. [^who]

## Hangovers

A hangover is a collection of unpleasant physical and mental symptoms that occur after a session of heavy alcohol consumption. These symptoms typically begin when the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) drops significantly, often the morning after drinking, and can last for several hours or even days.

Different types of alcoholic beverages can lead to varying hangover severity, and that this seems to be more related to the congeners in the drink rather than the sugar content.

> [!TIP] What are Congeners?
Congeners are substances other than ethanol that are produced during fermentation, and they contribute to the unique taste, aroma, and color of alcoholic beverages. Different drinks have different amounts and types of congeners.

Drinks like vodka, which has fewer congeners, tend to cause less severe hangovers compared to drinks like whiskey or red wine, which have more congeners. This is contrary to the popular belief that sugary drinks (or mixers) are the main culprit behind harsh hangovers.

This needs a citation!

This is a ranked list of drinks based on their likelihood to cause severe hangovers:

1. Vodka and beer cause the least severe hangovers
2. Gin causes slightly more severe hangovers
3. White wine and whiskey cause moderately severe hangovers
4. Rum and red wine cause even more severe hangovers
5. Brandy is most likely to cause the most severe hangovers
### Symptoms of a Hangover

Common symptoms of a hangover include:

1. Headache
2. Fatigue
3. Thirst and dry mouth
4. Nausea and vomiting
5. Dizziness
6. Sensitivity to light and sound
7. Rapid heartbeat
8. Decreased ability to concentrate
9. Mood disturbances, such as anxiety, irritability, or depression

### Scientific Explanation for Hangovers

The exact mechanisms behind hangovers are not fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to the development of hangover symptoms:

1. **Dehydration:** Alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it increases urine production and leads to dehydration. This can cause symptoms like thirst, dry mouth, and headaches.
2. **Inflammation:** Alcohol triggers an inflammatory response in the body, which can lead to symptoms such as headaches and fatigue.
3. **Acetaldehyde accumulation:** When the body breaks down alcohol, it first converts it to acetaldehyde, a toxic substance. If acetaldehyde accumulates faster than it can be metabolized, it can contribute to hangover symptoms.
4. **Disrupted sleep:** Although alcohol may help people fall asleep initially, it can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to poor sleep quality, exacerbating fatigue and cognitive impairment.
5. **Gastrointestinal distress:** Alcohol can irritate the lining of the stomach and increase acid production, leading to nausea and vomiting.
6. **Congeners:** These are byproducts of alcohol fermentation that are found in varying amounts in different alcoholic beverages. Congeners are thought to contribute to the severity of hangovers, with drinks high in congeners (such as whiskey and red wine) often causing worse hangovers than those with lower levels (like vodka and gin).
7. **Vitamin and electrolyte imbalances:** Alcohol consumption can deplete the body's stores of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, folate, and potassium, which may contribute to hangover symptoms.

### Curing Hangovers

While there is no guaranteed cure for a hangover, staying hydrated, getting plenty of rest, and allowing time for the body to process the alcohol can help alleviate symptoms. The most effective way to prevent a hangover is to moderate alcohol consumption or avoid drinking altogether.

## Why Drink Alcohol?

While we have documented the risks of excessive alcohol consumption, there are some potential benefits to moderate drinking. Note that none of them are *health* related reasons.

### Social Bonding

Drinking alcohol can be a social activity that facilitates bonding with friends, family, or colleagues. Sharing a drink can help break the ice, create a sense of camaraderie, and promote social interaction. However, it's important to note that ***social pressure to drink should never be the primary reason for consuming alcohol.***

### Enhancing creativity

>“Be always drunken.  
Nothing else matters:  
that is the only question.  
If you would not feel  
the horrible burden of Time  
weighing on your shoulders  
and crushing you to the earth,  
be drunken continually.  
Drunken with what?  
With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you will.  
But be drunken.  
And if sometimes,  
on the stairs of a palace,  
or on the green side of a ditch,  
or in the dreary solitude of your own room,  
you should awaken  
and the drunkenness be half or wholly slipped away from you,  
ask of the wind,  
or of the wave,  
or of the star,  
or of the bird,  
or of the clock,  
of whatever flies,  
or sighs,  
or rocks,  
or sings,  
or speaks,  
ask what hour it is;  
and the wind,  
wave,  
star,  
bird,  
clock will answer you:  
"It is the hour to be drunken!”
>
> **Charles Baudelaire (Paris Spleen)**

The relationship between alcohol and creativity is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people find that moderate alcohol consumption can help them relax and tap into their creative side, the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited. However, the perception that alcohol enhances creativity is widespread, particularly among artists and writers.

An interesting paper titled "[I Drink, Therefor I Am: Alcohol and Creativity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/014107689909201213)" discusses this at length:

> Heavy drinking is seen as a self-destructive activity that wreaks immense social and physical havoc. Individuals are exhorted to shun the attractions of alcohol and to lead a life of moderation. Clinicians who deal with the human consequences of excessive drinking - the broken homes, the victims of violence, the multiple physical and mental ills - feel justified in their condemnation of the drunkard. 
> 
> 
> However, this view does not enjoy an untroubled consensus with the lay public. In particular, many writers and artists take a quite different view. Here alcohol is prized for its ability to reveal new creative insights, and heroic drinking has long been part of the artistic persona. Rather than being seen as a sign of personal failing, alcoholism is taken as evidence of artistic integrity. [^beveridge]

### Enjoyment and relaxation

Many people find that they enjoy the taste of alcoholic beverages or the relaxing effects of moderate alcohol consumption. Having a drink can help you unwind after a stressful day or enhance your enjoyment of a meal or celebration. If you genuinely enjoy drinking alcohol in moderation, this can be a valid reason to include it in your life.

## The "Best Way" to Drink


While the healthiest approach to alcohol is abstinence, if you choose to drink, there are ways to minimize the risks and enhance the social benefits. 

Here are some guidelines for the "best way" to drink:

- **Don't drink regularly:** Frequent alcohol consumption, even in moderate amounts, can lead to health problems and increased tolerance. Limit your drinking to special occasions — make it count. 
- **Limit the number of drinks per session:** Stick to a maximum of 1-2 drinks per occasion to avoid the negative effects of binge drinking. This is especially important if you a woman or are not a heavy person. 
- **Eat a balanced meal beforehand:** Having food in your stomach slows down alcohol absorption. Opt for a meal with a mix of carbs, fat, and protein before drinking.
- **Stay hydrated:** Alternate between alcoholic drinks and water to reduce dehydration and hangover severity. This will provide distance between your drinks, making it less likely that you will drink too much. 
- **Drink in a safe environment:** Always consume alcohol in a secure setting, surrounded by people you trust.
- **Drink for the right reasons:** Choose to drink to enhance social interaction and enjoyment,  not as a coping mechanism for negative emotions. Think of pairing wine with a good meal, rather than sobbing into your gin and tonic alone in a bar. 
- **Never drink and drive:** Alcohol impairs judgment and reaction time. Always designate a sober driver or use a ride-sharing service.
- **Avoid mixing alcohol with other substances:** Combining alcohol with caffeine, energy drinks, or drugs can mask alcohol's effects and lead to risky behavior or adverse health consequences.


Sometimes, you may feel pressured to drink even when you don't want to. Here are some ways to say no:

- Mention that you're on antibiotics or other medication that interacts with alcohol.
- Give a general health reason, such as trying to stay healthy or not feeling great.
- Explain that you're the designated driver.
- Order a non-alcoholic drink that resembles a cocktail, like a soda with lime.
- Cite work commitments that require you to be sharp and focused.

Remember, being direct about not wanting to drink is perfectly acceptable. True friends will respect your decision. 

If you face persistent pressure, it may be time to reevaluate your social circle.

## How To Give Up Drinking

## Common Myths

### Alcohol Reduces Stress

Many people believe that alcohol can help them relax and reduce stress. However, while alcohol may provide temporary relaxation, it actually increases stress levels in the long run by interfering with the body's natural stress response systems.

### Alcohol Warms You Up

Contrary to popular belief, alcohol does not actually warm you up. While it may create a temporary sensation of warmth due to dilated blood vessels, it ultimately lowers your core body temperature, which can be dangerous in cold environments. [^granberg]

### Drinking More Alcohol Cures a Hangover

Drinking more alcohol to cure a hangover, also known as "hair of the dog," is a common myth. In reality, this practice only delays the inevitable and can lead to a cycle of alcohol dependence. [^vester] The best way to cure a hangover is to stay hydrated, get rest, and allow your body to process the alcohol.[^penning]




### Coffee Sobers You Up

Coffee or caffeine cannot sober someone up; it might make a person more alert but does not decrease blood alcohol levels or eliminate impairment. The only thing that can sober you up is time, as your liver needs to process the alcohol in your system.

### You Can "Sweat Out" Alcohol to Sober Up Faster

Exercise doesn't speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body. The liver metabolizes alcohol at a consistent rate regardless of physical activity. Attempting to "sweat out" alcohol can actually be dangerous, as it can lead to dehydration and other health risks.

### Alcohol Improves Sleep

While alcohol might help someone fall asleep quicker, it actually disrupts the sleep cycle, particularly the important REM ((Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, leading to poorer quality sleep overall. [^ebrahim] This can result in daytime fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.

### Beer and Wine Are Less Harmful Than Spirits

Alcohol's effect on the body is determined by the total amount of ethanol consumed, not the type of drink. Beer and wine can be just as harmful as spirits if consumed in large quantities. What matters is the alcohol content and the volume consumed, not the type of alcoholic beverage. [^Gronbaek]
### Eating Before Bed Absorbs Alcohol

Eating food can help slow the absorption of alcohol if done before or while drinking, but eating after you've already consumed alcohol won't affect the absorption much. Once alcohol is in your system, food has little effect on how your body processes it.

### Sugary Drinks Cause Worse Hangovers

Contrary to the popular belief that sugary drinks (or mixers) are the main culprit behind harsh hangovers, the severity of a hangover is more closely related to the amount of alcohol consumed and the presence of congeners (byproducts of fermentation) in the drink. Drinks with high congener content, such as whiskey and red wine, tend to cause worse hangovers than drinks with low congener content, like vodka and gin.


## notes 


- 63% of violent crimes involve alcohol [^mcmurran]
- Most sexual assaults occur when the victim is drunk, not drugged.[^elsohly]
- One of the most common date rape drugs is alcohol[^medicalnewstoday] [^schwartz]
- 5.3% of all deaths are caused by alcohol [^who]
- Total alcohol per capita consumption in 2016 among male and female drinkers worldwide was on average 19.4 litres of pure alcohol for males and 7.0 litres for females. [^who]
- Define Alcoholism
- Should define Binge Drinking 
	- Binge Drinking: Binge drinking, on the other hand, refers to consuming a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time, typically with the intention of becoming intoxicated. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08% or above. This typically corresponds to:
		- 5 or more drinks for males in about 2 hours
		- 4 or more drinks for females in about 2 hours
- Chronic Drinking
	- Chronic drinking refers to a consistent, habitual pattern of alcohol consumption over an extended period of time. It is often characterized by regular drinking on most days of the week, even if the amount consumed per occasion is relatively low. In the context of the Huberman Lab podcast, chronic drinking is defined as consuming on average 1-2 drinks per day, or 7-14 drinks per week.

Chronic drinking can lead to a range of health problems over time, including liver damage, high blood pressure, and an increased risk of certain cancers. It can also lead to psychological and social consequences, such as depression, anxiety, and relationship problems.
- Intersting graph about binge drinking and alcohol use in the US: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424850/figure/ch3.f1/
- In general, should consider NOT being to US centric through the entire guide if possible. 
- Some kind of notice about not being against drinking, put to present the evidence and make readers make their own decisions. To profess, not prescribe a specific way of living. 
- Huberman: even just a few drinks (one on a weekday and a few on the weekend) means that you have higher stress hormones.
- Huberman: interesting point about even moderate drinking, that it causes a decrease in top down inhibition and an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior. also changes in the very neural circuits so that you are more impulsive even when not drinking.
- In males, alcohol increases aromatization of testosterone to estrogen, which may lead to gynecomastia and decreased libido.
	- There is a good quote in Macbeth (I think) about alcohol giving the urgue but not the capcaity or something 

- Huberman: being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption
- It is full of empty calories
	- And the reason why alcohol is considered empty caloriesis because that entire process is very metabolically costly but there's no real nutritive value of the calories that it creates.
- Brief History of Alcohol, when it was first brewed. 
- Different types of alcohol?
- The fact that it goes right through the blood brain barrier?
- What is alcoholism?
	- Definition
	- How many drinks a week?
- Positive effects of alcohol
- What's the right amount to drink? let's not beat around the bush: zero.
- Does not help losing weight, body prioritizes metabolizing alcohol 
	- Alcohol consumption can indeed interfere with fat loss, and this is an important point that was not directly addressed in the Huberman Lab podcast.
	- When alcohol is consumed, it becomes the body's primary fuel source. The body prioritizes the metabolism of alcohol over other nutrients, including fat, because it cannot store alcohol and must work to eliminate it from the system. This is known as the "alcohol metabolism priority."
	- During this process, the body's normal fat-burning mechanisms are essentially put on hold. The liver, which is responsible for metabolizing alcohol, is also the primary site for fat metabolism. When the liver is busy processing alcohol, it cannot effectively metabolize fat, leading to a decrease in fat oxidation.
	- Furthermore, alcohol provides "empty" calories, meaning it contains calories (7 calories per gram) but no essential nutrients. These additional calories can contribute to weight gain or hinder weight loss efforts, especially when consumed in excess or in combination with sugary mixers or high-calorie snacks.
	- Alcohol can also indirectly impact fat loss by influencing appetite and food choices. It can lower inhibitions and lead to overeating or making less healthy food choices, further contributing to excess calorie intake.
	- While occasional, moderate alcohol consumption may not significantly derail fat loss efforts, regular or excessive drinking can certainly make it more challenging to achieve and maintain a healthy body composition. Those looking to optimize fat loss may benefit from reducing or eliminating alcohol intake in favor of nutrient-dense, lower-calorie alternatives.

	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_effects_of_alcohol_consumption
- "Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people."[nhs]
- A unit of alcohol is 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol[^nhs], which is about:
	- half a pint of lower to normal-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 3.6%)
	- a single small shot measure (25ml) of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%)
	- A small glass (125ml, ABV 12%) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol.
