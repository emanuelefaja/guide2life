# Coffee

Chances are, you drink coffee. If you do, then you should learn *how* to drink coffee, because while coffee has various health benefits, too much can cause various health risks, and there is also the possibility that coffee is affecting the quality of your sleep and your anxiety levels. 

One of the core concepts of Guide2Life is making conscious decisions and designing the life that you want *and* need. 

Coffee is no exception. 

Many of us drink coffee because everyone else drinks coffee — and because it also helps us keep awake in the morning.  This is our *"default philosophy"* of coffee. But perhaps we should consider this more deeply, and only *then* make an informed choice on coffee consumption 

## What is Coffee

Explain the different types of coffee beans, primarily focusing on Arabica and Robusta. Describe their characteristics, flavors, and which types of coffee they are best suited for

### How Coffee is made

Detail the process from bean to cup:

- **Growing**: Discuss where coffee is grown and the conditions it requires[15](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coffee).
- **Harvesting**: Explain how coffee cherries are harvested.

### History of Coffee

Origins

Include interesting anecdotes, such as the story of Kaldi, the Ethiopian goatherd who noticed his goats became energetic after eating coffee berries

Roots trace back to ancient oral traditions in modern-day Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen.

First Known Use

Known in Mecca by the 15th century and used by Sufi monasteries in Yemen to aid concentration.

Spread to Europe

Arrived in Italy in the second half of the 16th century through Mediterranean trade; spread throughout Central and Eastern Europe from the Ottomans.

Emergence of Coffee Houses

Coffee houses became popular in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in Holland, England, and Germany.

Introduction to the New World

Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720, leading to the spread across the Caribbean and to Mexico.

Brazil's Dominance

By 1852, Brazil became the world's largest coffee producer, a title it holds to this day.

Major Producers

Notable coffee producers today include Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; Vietnam became the second-largest producer in 1999.

Fast forward today, and 30-40% of the world drinks coffee.

## How Coffee Works

Coffee keeps you alert primarily through the effects of its main active ingredient, caffeine.

To understand *how* caffeine keeps you alert, we need to understand a little about how the brain works. 

This is an interesting question: how does the body know that it is tired and should go to sleep?

Think about it — it's not as obvious as you may think. 

This mechanism of become more and more sleepy and then going to sleep is primarily controlled by a neurotranmitter (a biochemical in the brain) called Adenoise. Throughout the day, adenosine levels build up in the brain, binding to adenosine receptors, which slows down brain activity and makes you feel tired. 

Caffeine wroks because it looks similar to adenosine and can bind to the same receptors. However, unlike adenosine, caffeine doesn’t activate these receptors. Instead, it blocks them.

By binding to adenosine receptors, caffeine prevents adenosine from attaching to them. This inhibits the normal sleep-promoting effects of adenosine, leading to increased alertness and wakefulness because the brain's natural slowing mechanism is blocked

With adenosine blocked, the brain’s natural stimulants like [dopamine](/health/biochemicals/neurotransmitters/dopamine) and norepinephrine can work more freely. This results in enhanced transmission of nerve signals and increased brain activity, making you feel more awake and alert

the brain does react by creating more adenosine receptors in response to chronic caffeine intake. This adaptation is a form of physiological compensation for the continuous presence of caffeine, which blocks the normal action of adenosine at its receptors. As caffeine consistently inhibits adenosine from binding to its receptors, the brain attempts to counteract this effect by synthesizing more adenosine receptors. This increase in receptor density can lead to tolerance, meaning that over time, more caffeine is required to achieve the same alerting effects.Additionally, if a chronic caffeine user suddenly stops consuming caffeine, the now-abundant adenosine receptors can lead to enhanced sensitivity to adenosine, resulting in increased drowsiness and other withdrawal symptoms.

**What is defined as "chronic caffeine user"**:  
A chronic caffeine user is typically defined as someone who regularly consumes caffeine over an extended period. This can include daily consumption of caffeine-containing products like coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks. The term "chronic" implies long-term and consistent use rather than occasional or sporadic consumption. Chronic caffeine users may develop tolerance to some of the effects of caffeine, necessitating higher doses to achieve the same effects previously attained with lower doses

**Does this mean that drinking coffee is, in some ways, useless as it's a continuous war of escalation between caffeine and the brain's ability to create new adenosine receptors?**:  
Not necessarily. While it is true that chronic consumption of caffeine can lead to the upregulation of adenosine receptors, which in turn can diminish the stimulatory effects of caffeine, this doesn't render coffee or other caffeine sources entirely useless. Many individuals continue to experience sufficient benefits from their regular caffeine intake, such as improved alertness, concentration, and mood elevation, despite some level of tolerance[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3003150/)[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1888264/)[8](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-tolerance). Additionally, caffeine's effects are not solely limited to antagonism of adenosine receptors; it also influences other neurotransmitter systems and has various physiological effects that can contribute to its overall impact[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1888264/)[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153505/)

## Health Benefits

- **Improves mental alertness**: Coffee increases alertness and enhances cognitive functions[5](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-980/coffee).
- **Supports heart health**: Moderate coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of heart disease[4](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee)[8](https://www.rush.edu/news/health-benefits-coffee).
- **Lowers risk of type 2 diabetes**: Regular coffee drinking is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes[3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270202)[8](https://www.rush.edu/news/health-benefits-coffee).
- **Protects against Parkinson's disease**: Coffee may have neuroprotective properties that lower the risk of Parkinson's disease[3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270202)[8](https://www.rush.edu/news/health-benefits-coffee).
- **Reduces risk of certain cancers**: Coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of liver, prostate, breast, colore

## Health Risks

Health risks are primarily associcated with excessive consumption, not moderate consumption.

Increase in blood pressure: Coffee can temporarily raise blood pressure, which may be a concern for individuals with hypertension
.
Heartburn and digestive issues: Coffee can exacerbate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and cause heartburn
.
Increased anxiety and nervousness: Due to its caffeine content, coffee can lead to heightened anxiety, nervousness, and even panic attacks in sensitive individuals
.
Insomnia and sleep disturbances: Caffeine can interfere with sleep, causing difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep, especially when consumed later in the day
.
Dependency and withdrawal symptoms: Regular consumption can lead to caffeine dependency, and abrupt cessation can result in withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability, and fatigue
.
Increased heart rate and palpitations: Some people may experience a faster heart rate and palpitations after consuming coffee
.
Potential impact on pregnancy: Pregnant women are often advised to limit their caffeine intake due to potential risks such as miscarriage or low birth weight
.
Bone density and osteoporosis: There is some concern that excessive coffee consumption might lead to decreased bone density, particularly in individuals who do not consume adequate calcium
.

These negative effects highlight the importance of moderation in coffee consumption and consideration of individual health conditions when including coffee in one's diet

## Coffee & Brain

## Caffeine & Sleep

## Optimal Strategy for regulating coffee intake.

Yes, caffeine withdrawal symptoms can be quite severe for some individuals, especially if they quit caffeine abruptly. The symptoms can indeed resemble those of the flu, including headache, fatigue, irritability, depressed mood, and difficulty concentrating. Some people may also experience dizziness or light-headedness, nausea, and muscle pain or stiffness, which can further contribute to the feeling of being unwell, similar to flu-like symptoms[1](https://www.health.com/caffeine-withdrawal-7095696)[2](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-to-expect-from-caffeine-withdrawal-21844)[4](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms)[7](https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/long-caffeine-withdrawal-headaches-3554936/). The severity of these symptoms can vary widely among individuals, depending on factors such as the amount of caffeine regularly consumed and individual sensitivity to caffeine withdrawal

Don't go cold turkey, but track the numebr of cups that you take each day. Perhaps start by not drinking the full cup. Also link to the youtube video taht shows how someone worked out a strategy (which works at home) of slowly adding more and more decaf, so you hardly notice it. This works well if you are ina controlled environment. 



## Coffee & Anxiety

This is worth having its own separate section for.

1. "I can feel a connection in my body between coffee and anxiety – when I drink too much coffee my anxiety is heightened" [1](https://girlandtonic.co.uk/coffee-and-anxiety/).
2. "Caffeine increases stress hormones. Most people with anxiety would agree they have too much stress in their lives — and caffeine adds to the burden" [1](https://girlandtonic.co.uk/coffee-and-anxiety/).
3. "The reality is, caffeine itself doesn’t actually cause anxiety... it can just lead to (or increase) sensations and symptoms that mimic those of anxiety" [2](https://www.ahealthypush.com/post/the-truth-about-caffeine-anxiety).
4. "For some individuals, the anxiety effect is immediate, with symptoms appearing shortly after consuming coffee" [3](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/collective/healthy-habits/a44936567/coffee-anxiety/).
5. "Coffee contains caffeine, a natural stimulant that affects the brain by blocking adenosine receptors... However, caffeine can also have a paradoxical effect on certain individuals, triggering anxiety instead of alertness" [3](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/collective/healthy-habits/a44936567/coffee-anxiety/).
6. "I also started noticing that I was getting more jittery and anxious" [4](https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-quit-coffee-after-25-years-energy-less-anxiety-2023-2).
7. "Caffeine can trigger anxiety in people who consume too much of it. The symptoms can include restlessness, trouble sleeping, and an increased heart rate, all of which I experienced" [4](https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-quit-coffee-after-25-years-energy-less-anxiety-2023-2).

## Suggestion: Give up and start again

If you are a regular coffee drinker, try to cut it out for one month. You don't have to quit instantly. You can simply reduce your coffee intake day by day, and eventually take one month off.

Think of it as an experiment. You can try for one month, and the upside is that perhaps you do not need coffee, or perhaps a lot less than before, and you are more in control of your life. Or, you go back to your regular schedule of drinking coffee, and nothing particularly bad has happened. 

However, thsi puts you in the drivers seat. You control your coffee consumption.

  Link this to some ancient romans who did things just because they were difficult and that was just fine.
