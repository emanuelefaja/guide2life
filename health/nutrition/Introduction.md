This should be about the daily choices and responsbility, andthat this is one of the foundations of self control, and perhaps a quote about it being the fisrt thing to control. I should also review the discussion I had with Claude on Epictetus on this, and there are soem interesting parts to review there as well.

I should also tell a funyn anectodae about my mum telling me that was nobody was forcing me to eat anything, it was fully under my control almost always, and I would say that this applies to everyone for siure.
