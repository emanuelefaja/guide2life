# What is Health?
> "No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable." **Socrates.**

You will die — this is an inevitable truth that every human being must face. 

While cannot escape mortality, you can significantly influence the length and quality of your life through the choices you make and the actions you take.

Health, along with time, is one of the most precious resources you have. 

>[!TIP] Health is both about extending the length and quality of your life.
>In other words, increases the amount of quality-time in your life. There’s no point living to 110 years old, if for the last 30 years you’re just vegetable.
>Everything else being equal, more quality-time is better. 

And there is an interesting dynamic between health and time. 

Our current state of health is largely the legacy of our past selves, while our future well-being is a hostage to the choices we make today. You should live today in a way that your future self will thank you for.

Poor diet, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking contribute significantly to the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and various cancers.

By making conscious decisions to lead healthier lives, we can mitigate these risks and improve our long-term health outcomes. It's crucial to recognize that every healthy choice we make adds up, influencing not just our present state but also our future wellbeing.

## Do Not Forget To live 

There is a saying that the safest place for a ship is in the harbour, but then whole poitn of a ship is to be out int he open ocean. Similarly, you do not want to be come so concerned about your health that you forget that you also have to live. 

The body *does* have mechanisms to recover from a less than ideal diet or health regiment, and so there is evidence that some stressors may actually improve health (reference). And so, what we are trying to say here is that you can let your hair down a little and live.
