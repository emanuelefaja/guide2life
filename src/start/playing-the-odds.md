# Playing The Odds.

You can do everything wrong, and terrible things can still happen, and vice-versa. There are people who smoke 40 cigarettes a day and live to be 95 without any health issues, and others who have never smoked a day in their lives who develop lung cancer. But we should ignore these outliers — you can only control what you can control. Life is inherently unpredictable. While we strive to make informed choices, it's crucial to recognize the role of chance in our outcomes.

Imagine that instead of one life, you could repeat your life 1,000 times. What outcomes would most likely prevail?

In this probabilistic view, it’s not about the rare exceptions but about playing the odds wisely in your favor. This perspective helps you make decisions based on likely outcomes, not outliers.
