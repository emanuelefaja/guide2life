# How To Use This. 
There is a lot of information in Guide2Life. 

However, life is not school.  You are not going to be tested on the role of Insulin on body fat or the effects of meditation on your mental state.

**The most important thing is behavior change — changing your identity to take on new behavioral patterns that serve you.[^1]**

## Action vs Knowledge

There is a famous Buddhist parable from the [Cūḷamālukya Sutta](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Cūḷamālukya_Sutta) that makes the point of action vs knowledge perfectly:

> It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, _'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker.'_ He would say, _'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name & clan name of the man who wounded me... until I know whether he was tall, medium, or short... until I know whether he was dark, ruddy-brown, or golden-colored... until I know his home village, town, or city... until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow... until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber, bamboo threads, sinew, hemp, or bark... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated... until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a peacock, or another bird... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox, a water buffalo, a langur, or a monkey.'_ He would say, _'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barbed, a calf-toothed, or an oleander arrow.'_ The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him.

You do not have understand the precise process of how bacteria causes dental problems in order to brush your teeth everyday. It just becomes part of who you are, a person who brushes their teeth twice a day. You hardly think about it.  

Similarly, when it comes to the information presented in Guide2Life, the goal is not to simply learn and memorize facts. **Instead, use the knowledge to make meaningful changes in your daily life​. [^2]**

If you learn about how insulin works and its impact on body fat, the point is not to become an expert on insulin physiology. Instead, the objective is to make different eating choices each day based on that knowledge, such as choosing lower glycemic index foods, being mindful of portion sizes, or practicing OMAD.

Over time, as you consistently apply this knowledge to your daily choices, the specific details about insulin may fade from your memory. However, the new actions and behaviors you've adopted will stick with you, becoming ingrained habits that positively impact your health and well-being.


## Recommendations

### Start Small

It’s tempting to try and make multiple large, drastic changes at  the same time. 

Don’t do this — the failure rates for this approach are horrific. 

Instead, choose a single habit or practice to implement in your daily life, and gradually build upon your successes as you progress.
