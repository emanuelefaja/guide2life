# Dopamine

[REMEBER TO MAKE ALL OF THIS VERY CLEAR! This is a complex topic, but you need to make it easy to understand.]

Understanding dopamine is *essential* for living a well-lived life.  

Your brain, and more specifically the chemicals inside of it, can be your best friend, or your worst enemy. The electrical signals firing off in there are — *literally* —your conscious experience. 

There could be no higher stakes. 

So this may be one of the most important guides in Guide2Life.  

Unfortunately, the internet is filled with misinformation and oversimplifications about this crucial neurotransmitter, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. This is where Guide2Life comes in. Our mission is to provide you with a comprehensive, evidence-based understanding of dopamine and its far-reaching impact on your health, happiness, and overall success. 

Ancient philosophers like Socrates, Aristotle, and the Stoics intuitively grasped the impact of inner drives on well-being based purely on reflection and observation. They advocated for moderating desires and practicing delayed gratification to achieve a balanced life. 

> "Moderation in all things" **Aristotle.**

Modern science now validates these insights, confirming Dopamine's role in experiencing pleasure, setting goals, and engaging in meaningful activities. Research shows that dopamine overstimulation can lead to addiction and decreased well-being, echoing ancient warnings against excess. Contemporary approaches that adjust dopamine levels to enhance long-term contentment and reduce dependency on external rewards reflect these timeless wisdoms.

By delving into the latest research and expert insights, we'll demystify Dopamine and give you the tools you need to optimize your brain function, enhance your motivation, and achieve your goals. 

This understanding isn't just academic; it has practical implications. 

By understanding its function, we can better manage our health, psychological well-being, and overall life satisfaction.

[add this somewhere here? Dopamine cannot give you satisfaction more than a hammer can turn a screen.]

Whether you're seeking to improve your focus, break free from addiction, or simply live a more balanced life, this definitive guide to dopamine will be your roadmap. By exploring dopamine's fascinating world, from its evolutionary origins to its practical applications, you'll gain a clear understanding of how this powerful molecule shapes your experiences and how to harness its potential to create the life you desire.
## What is Dopamine?
> "Dopamine is the molecule that makes us look at things outside the boundaries of our skin, to be in pursuit of things." **Andrew Huberman.**


[ I think perhaps instead of jumping directly into Dopamine, I should have a dsicussion about this:
 Simple distinction of up and down
	- down 
		- Paripersonal space
		- space around you within arms reach
		- Typically thigns you own and control
		- You use them, control them, consume them
	- Up
		- Extrapersonal space
		- Outside of your arms reach
		- If you want something in the extraperosnal space, you have to make effort
		- small effort --> Picking up a book
		- Large effort --> Planning a trip
		- These are abstract, and it all takes place in the future
- The brain uses chemicals to process things in the future, into the abstract, imaginery, you use one single brain chemical called Dopamine]


Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a chemical messenger in the brain that plays a crucial role regulating movement, motivation, drive, craving, time-perception, and reward mechanisms. 

Dopamine is often called the *"molecule of more"* because it drives us to seek out rewards and motivates us to pursue our goals. It helps us learn from past experiences and shapes our future behavior. 

It is an ancient molecule that has been present in living organisms for hundreds of millions of years. It is found not only in humans but also in many other animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates. It was discovered in 1957 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the National Heart Institute of Sweden.

Dopamine is believed to have first appeared in ancient invertebrates, possibly as early as 600 million years ago. Its widespread presence across the animal kingdom, from worms and insects to fish and mammals, highlights its evolutionary significance. The fact that dopamine has been conserved throughout the evolution of such diverse life forms suggests that it plays a critical role in the survival and fitness of organisms. Its ancient origins and ubiquity underscore its importance in shaping behavior, facilitating learning, and promoting adaptability in the face of changing environments.

[add some of this stuff here:
- Why did evolution create different pathways for what we have and what we don't have.
- From a survival point of view, it would be you have, or you are dead.
- There is a big difference between what you have and what you dont, and that can be life or death.

In fact, dopamine is playing a key role in driving you to read this very sentence right now! 

Without dopamine, we would struggle to:

1. **Move:** Dopamine is essential for controlling movement. Without it, we would have difficulty initiating and executing actions, similar to the symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease.
2. **Feel motivated:** Dopamine drives us to pursue rewards and engage in goal-directed behavior. Without it, we would lack the motivation to even get out of bed in the morning.
3. **Experience pleasure:** Dopamine is involved in the experience of pleasure and satisfaction. Without it, we may find it difficult to enjoy activities that we once found rewarding.
4. **Learn from experiences:** Dopamine plays a key role in associative learning, helping us connect our actions to their outcomes. Without it, we would struggle to learn from our successes and failures.


It looks like this: 

![](/dopamine.png)


Despite its importance, only a *tiny* fraction  (0.0000002%) of the brain's neurons — around 20,000 out of 100 billion — produce dopamine. 

To put this in perspective, if the world's population were neurons, *only 1,600 people out of 8 billion would be capable of generating dopamine!* 

From an evolutionary perspective, dopamine played a key role in survival by motivating our ancestors to seek out resources and avoid threats. 

Today, it still drives us to pursue things we desire, whether it's a delicious meal, a new gadget, a promotion at work, or learning how to improve our lives. 

However, this powerful motivational system can also be hijacked by addictive substances and behaviors, leading to compulsive pursuit of rewards despite negative consequences. 

> "Often we’re more about the anticipation and pursuit of pleasure than about the experience of it." **Robert M. Sapolsky.**

It's crucial to understand that addiction is not about the specific drugs or behaviors, but rather the dopamine surge they trigger in the brain. All addictive substances and behaviors, despite their differences, share a common mechanism: they cause a rapid and intense increase in dopamine levels in the brain's reward system.

In essence, dopamine is a double-edged sword.

It's essential for healthy functioning and goal-directed behavior but it can also contribute to a host of problems, from addiction to attention deficits.

By understanding how dopamine works, we can gain insight into our own motivations and behaviors, and learn strategies for harnessing its power while avoiding its pitfalls.

Not sure where this should go:

Modulation of time perception: Dopamine has been shown to influence the perception of time. Increased dopamine levels can lead to an overestimation of time intervals, while decreased levels may cause an underestimation. This unique property has implications for temporal decision-making, impulsivity, and the subjective experience of time.

## Dopamine Patterns

[should also add here about local and global transmission]

To understand how dopamine functions in the brain, it's important to recognize that it is released in two distinct patterns: 

1. Tonic 
2. Phasic

Let's dive in. 

#### Tonic
Tonic refers to the baseline or steady-state level of dopamine in the brain when we're not actively engaged in rewarding or motivating activities.

This baseline level varies between individuals and can influence overall motivation, energy levels, and even personality traits. For example, people with naturally higher tonic dopamine levels may be more motivated, energetic, and outgoing, while those with lower baseline levels may be more prone to apathy or low energy.

Think of your dopamine baseline as the foundation upon which your motivational and reward-seeking experiences are built. If you have a naturally higher dopamine baseline, you may generally feel more motivated, energetic, and driven to pursue goals and rewards. People with high dopamine baselines often describe themselves as "go-getters" or "thrill-seekers," always ready for the next challenge or exciting experience.

On the other hand, if you have a lower dopamine baseline, you may tend to feel less motivated or enthusiastic about pursuing rewards. Lower dopamine baselines have been associated with a higher risk of apathy, low energy, and even depression. People with low dopamine baselines may find it harder to get excited about new experiences or to stay committed to long-term goals.

It's important to note that having a low dopamine baseline doesn't necessarily mean you'll experience these negative outcomes, just as having a high baseline doesn't guarantee success or happiness. Many factors, including genetics, environment, and lifestyle, can influence your dopamine function and overall well-being.

One key concept related to dopamine baselines is the idea of "peaks" or phasic dopamine release. When we experience rewards or engage in motivating activities, dopamine levels temporarily spike above the baseline. The height and duration of these peaks can vary depending on the intensity and novelty of the reward.

What's interesting is that the relative difference between your baseline and these peaks may be more important than the absolute levels of dopamine. If you have a low dopamine baseline, even a small increase in dopamine can feel rewarding and motivating. In contrast, if you have a high baseline, you may need a bigger spike to feel the same level of reward or motivation.

This concept has important implications for how we structure our lives and pursue our goals. By understanding our own dopamine baselines and how different activities affect our dopamine levels, we can make informed choices about how to optimize our motivation and well-being. This might involve strategies like setting ambitious but achievable goals, seeking out novel experiences, or practicing mindfulness and gratitude to appreciate small rewards along the way.

Ultimately, while we can't directly control our dopamine baselines, we can work with them by creating lifestyles and habits that support healthy dopamine function. By doing so, we can tap into the power of this neurotransmitter to drive us towards the things that matter most, while also maintaining a sense of balance and well-being.

### Phasic

In contrast, phasic dopamine refers to the rapid, transient peaks in dopamine levels that occur in response to specific stimuli or events. These peaks are what we typically associate with rewards, motivation, and learning. The height and duration of these phasic dopamine peaks can vary depending on the situation and the individual.

Importantly, it's not just the absolute level of dopamine that matters, but rather the relative change in dopamine levels. A larger and longer-lasting phasic dopamine spike will have a more significant impact on behavior and learning compared to a smaller or shorter-lived spike.

Different activities and experiences can influence both the height and duration of phasic dopamine spikes. For example, unexpected rewards or novel experiences may trigger a large, short-lived dopamine spike, while familiar or expected rewards may elicit a smaller but more sustained dopamine release.

::: details  **Dopamine is not the "pleasure chemical"**

One of the most pervasive myths about dopamine is that it is the main neurochemical responsible for pleasure. While dopamine is indeed involved in the brain's reward system, its role is more complex than simply generating pleasurable sensations.

Dopamine is better described as a "wanting" or "seeking" neurotransmitter. It drives motivation, anticipation, and goal-directed behavior, but it does not directly cause the experience of pleasure itself. Instead, other neurotransmitters, such as opioids and endocannabinoids, are more closely linked to the actual sensation of pleasure.

This distinction is important because it helps us understand why certain activities or substances can be highly motivating and habit-forming without necessarily being pleasurable in the moment. Dopamine's role is to reinforce behaviors that are associated with rewards, even if those rewards are not always immediately gratifying.

So, while dopamine is certainly involved in the reward circuit, it's essential to recognize its nuanced role in motivation and learning rather than simply equating it with pleasure. 

[add this bit below, and link to reward prediciton error]
This is all wrong, and it is more complex, and lot more powerful
	- It is very unlikely that this circuit evolved to respond to cocaine. Much more likely to respond for food.
	- Dropped a pellet of food to a mouse, his dopamine spiked.
	- What if we do this every day at the same time? If the rat expects the reward, the dopamine is gone.
	- Why?
	- The answer is not the dopamine of pleasure, it is the dopamine is the molecule of novelty.
	- Only unexpected rewards spike dopamine.
	- This is called Reward Prediction Error
		- Dopamine Release = Actual Reward - Expected Reward

:::

Over time, the brain learns to associate certain cues and behaviors with these dopamine peaks, which can reinforce habits and shape future behavior. This learning process is mediated by changes in the connections between neurons, a phenomenon known as synaptic plasticity.

By understanding the interplay between tonic and phasic dopamine, as well as the factors that influence dopamine release, we can gain valuable insights into how this neurotransmitter shapes our motivations, habits, and overall well-being. In the following sections, we'll explore some of the key mechanisms and pathways through which dopamine exerts its effects on the brain and behavior.

### Common Dopamine Triggers

The table below presents estimates of how various activities and substances can increase dopamine levels above an individual's baseline.

| Action                  | % Increase in Dopamine Baseline |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Sex                     | 100-200%                        |
| Nicotine (from smoking) | 150-200%                        |
| Cocaine                 | 300-800%                        |
| Amphetamines            | 1000%+                          |
| Caffeine (from coffee)  | 30-50%                          |
| Alcohol                 | 40-80%                          |
| Chocolate               | 100%                            |
| Exercise                | 50-100%                         |
| Listening to music      | 10-20%                          |
| Meditation              | 10-20%                          |

## Dopamine Pathways

Dopamine influences various brain pathways, each linked to distinct aspects of life—from movement and executive function to emotional response and motivation. 

>[!TIP] What is a pathway?
>A dopamine pathway is a series of connected brain regions that use dopamine to communicate with each other, like a network of roads that dopamine travels along to send signals and influence specific functions, such as motivation, reward processing, or decision-making.

Two of these pathways are particularly important for understanding behavior, motivation, and well-being:

1. **Mesolimbic pathway**: Often called the "reward pathway," this pathway is crucial for motivation, reward processing, and learning. It connects the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus. When we anticipate or experience rewards, dopamine is released in this pathway, reinforcing the behaviors that led to the reward. However, imbalances in this pathway can contribute to issues like addiction and mood disorders.
2. **Mesocortical pathway**: This pathway links the VTA to the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-order cognitive functions like decision-making, impulse control, and working memory. Dopamine in this pathway helps us stay focused, motivated, and goal-directed. Dysregulation of the mesocortical pathway has been linked to conditions like ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.

These two pathways work closely together to shape our behaviors, habits, and emotional experiences. They help us learn from rewards, stay motivated, and make decisions that support our well-being.

Other dopamine pathways, like the nigrostriatal pathway (involved in motor control) and the tuberoinfundibular pathway (involved in hormone regulation), also play important roles in brain function. However, the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways are the most directly relevant to understanding how dopamine influences our day-to-day behaviors and well-being.

## Reward Prediction Error

Reward Prediction Error (RPE) is a concept in neuroscience and psychology that refers to the difference between the expected reward and the actual reward received. It is a key component of reinforcement learning, which is the process by which organisms learn to modify their behavior based on the consequences of their actions.

In the context of the brain's reward system, RPE is thought to be encoded by dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). These neurons fire in response to unexpected rewards or cues that predict rewards, and their activity is thought to drive learning and decision-making.

Here's how RPE works:

1. If an outcome is better than expected (positive RPE), dopamine neurons increase their firing rate, signaling a positive prediction error. This reinforces the behavior that led to the reward, making it more likely to be repeated in the future.
2. If an outcome is worse than expected (negative RPE), dopamine neurons decrease their firing rate, signaling a negative prediction error. This weakens the behavior that led to the disappointing outcome, making it less likely to be repeated.
3. If an outcome is exactly as expected (zero RPE), there is no change in dopamine firing, as the prediction matches the actual outcome.

RPE is thought to be a fundamental mechanism by which the brain learns from experience and adapts behavior to maximize rewards and minimize punishments. It has been studied extensively in the context of decision-making, addiction, and various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

### Interactions with Other Neurotransmitters

Dopamine and Other Neurotransmitters

- Relationship between dopamine and other neurotransmitters
    - Serotonin
    - Norepinephrine
    - Glutamate
- How these interactions influence brain function and behavior
- - There is only one reward system
	- If you don't receive reward, you lie down in bed and die.
	- This has been tested on animals, and these animals have no will to live.
	- You need this. Reward is the survival of the species.
	- Reward and contentment are not the same thing. Reward and pleasure are synomnous
	- Happiness and contentment are synomous.
	- We have conflated pleasure and happiness.
	- There are seven differences between the two, and people need to understand the world and how they are being manipulated by the owlrd to be miseralbe:
		- Pleasure is short term, happiness is long term
		- Pleasure is visceral, happiness is etheral you feel it above the nack
		- Pleasure is taken, happiness is given
		- Pleasure is achieved alone, happiness is achived socially
		- Pleasure is achievable with substances, happiness is not
		- The extremes of pleasure (i..e heroin) are addictive. There is always a "holic". Alhocolic, shopaholic. Happiness 
		- Pleasure is dopamine
		- Happiness is Seratonin.
-  "Here and now" checmicals
	- Serotonin
	- Endocannabinoid
	- Oxytocin
	- Endorphyn
- Dopamine cannot give you satisfaction more than a hammer can turn a screen.


## Likes vs Wants

- We have use these words interchangibly in language.
- However, when it comes to the brain functions, these are actually completely separate!
- Dopamine can make you want something that you (the conscious you from your frontal cortex) do not really like
	- Burger when you're on a diet
	- One Nights stands when you're trying to get into a relationship or you're with a partner
	- Heroin when you're trying to live a good live
	- Pornography when you you should go out there and have a partner.
- Like = Desire = Dopamine
- Want = ?? = Serotonin
- - Dopamine vs Serotonin
	- Dopamine: This feels good, I want more.
	- Serotonin: This feels good, I don't want or need any more.
	- If you do not know the difference, you will try to reward yourself ad-nauseum
	- Cortisol is the stress hormone, what it does, which is particularly important, it works on the pre-frontal cortex. This is the part of the brain that stops you doing stupid things. 
	- If you have a dysfunctional pre-frontal cortex you cannot see the future, you only live for the moment
	- This dysfunction turns a human into a lizard.
	- Dopamine + Cortisol = Addiction
	- Reward is good, reward + stress is not good, leads to addiction.

## How To Use Dopamine

Not sure what to call this section! 

- Water (Huberman mentions European Journal of Physiology)
- - Improving Baseline Dopamine
- Leveraging Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort

1. To get started, break up high dopamine activities. **Don't layer high dopamine activities**. Spread them out. e.g. Porn, break, masturbate, break, drink. This counts for healthy activities too. Don't eat and watch your favourite show at the same time, even if it's healthy food.
    
2. **Don't peak your dopamine before or after work/study**. I'm trying to learn Japanese. It's hard and boring. But only because I do high level dopmine activities before it and/or after. If you drop those, or do them later on in the day, after only a couple of days studying becomes a lot easier and more fun. The activity itself gives me the most dopamine.
    
3. **Don't start your day with a high dopamine activity**. So studying first thing in the morning is a good idea. Maybe meditate or do something you've always wanted to get good at. This allows you to slowly raise your dopamine level, cementing that activity in your mind as pleasurable. Don't forget rule 2 though.
    
4. If you're completely unmotivated; **move first thing in the morning**. Go for a walk. Movement releases dopamine (without cause too much of a peak). Have a warm shower and gently make it as cold as you can handle. Warm up through movement after. This raises your baseline dopamine for several hours so you can get things done.
    
5. **Look for things you're grateful for (about what your doing) while studying/working**. This gives you small peaks of dopamine that train you to enjoy what your doing, even if right now it's kinda boring. Give it a couple of days.
    
6. **Don't reward yourself every time**. This one's a bit counterintuitive, but the (expected) reward will spike your dopamine and make the activity itself less pleasurable. If you then don't get the reward for some reason, the activity will seem less attractive. Randomise when you get the reward. This is why gambling and lootboxes are so addictive, use it to your advantage. Personally I haven't implemented this point yet, I just don't reward myself. Anyone have any good ideas?

## Dopamine Problems

While dopamine plays a crucial role in motivation, reward processing, and overall well-being, imbalances or dysregulation in the dopamine system can lead to various problems. This section will explore some of the most common issues related to dopamine function and how they tie into the broader discussion of dopamine's impact on our lives.

One unfortunate issue, is that you cannot easily monitor your even levels of dopamine, but may be able to recognize the symptoms which can help you lead a further investigation.

### Low Baseline

Individuals with naturally low dopamine baselines may struggle with:

- Lack of motivation and drive
- Apathy and low energy levels
- Difficulty initiating tasks or pursuing goals
- Increased risk of depression and anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure)

Low dopamine baselines can make it harder to engage with rewarding activities and may require more significant or frequent dopamine spikes to maintain motivation.

### High Baseline

On the other hand, excessively high dopamine baselines can also be problematic, potentially leading to:

- Impulsivity and risk-taking behavior
- Difficulty with delayed gratification
- Increased susceptibility to addiction
- Agitation or anxiety in some cases

People with high dopamine baselines may constantly seek out new and exciting experiences to maintain their elevated dopamine levels.

### Too Many Spikes

Frequent, intense spikes in dopamine, often caused by drugs, excessive rewards, or behavioral addictions, can lead to:

- Desensitization of dopamine receptors over time
- Difficulty deriving pleasure from everyday activities
- Increased tolerance, requiring larger or more frequent dopamine spikes to achieve the same effect
- Heightened risk of addiction and compulsive behavior

- Buz Aldrin --> Went to the moon, alcoholic, divocern two women, went to hospital, but for a period of time that lifted him to heaves, made his life a kind of hell. 

### Dopamine Deficiency 
### Dopamine & Addiction

- We've explored the crucial role that dopamine plays in motivation, reward processing, and learning. However, these same mechanisms that drive us towards healthy rewards can also be hijacked by addictive substances and behaviors, leading to the development of addiction.

- Addictive drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, directly target the brain's dopamine system. They cause massive, rapid spikes in dopamine levels, far beyond what natural rewards can elicit. Referring back to the table of dopamine increases, we can see that drugs like cocaine and amphetamines can increase dopamine levels by hundreds or even thousands of percent above baseline, whereas natural rewards like food or sex typically increase dopamine by a much smaller amount.

- These intense dopamine spikes are what drive the initial "high" or euphoria associated with drug use. However, as drug use continues, the brain's dopamine system begins to adapt. Dopamine receptors may become less sensitive, requiring larger doses of the drug to achieve the same effect. This is known as tolerance.

- Over time, the brain may also start to produce less dopamine naturally, as it relies on the artificial stimulation provided by the drug. This can lead to a decrease in baseline dopamine levels, making it harder for the individual to experience pleasure or motivation from everyday activities. This is one reason why addiction is often characterized by a loss of interest in hobbies, relationships, or responsibilities that were once important.

- In essence, addiction creates a vicious cycle. The individual needs to take more and more of the drug to overcome tolerance and achieve the desired dopamine spike, but this further dysregulates the dopamine system, making it harder to find pleasure or motivation in anything else. This cycle can be incredibly difficult to break, as the individual may experience intense cravings and withdrawal symptoms when attempting to quit.
## Common Myths

### Dopamine is the "pleasure chemical"

While dopamine is often associated with pleasure and reward, it's not the sole neurochemical responsible for these experiences. Dopamine is more accurately described as a "wanting" or "seeking" neurotransmitter, driving motivation and goal-directed behavior. Other neurotransmitters, such as opioids and endocannabinoids, play a more direct role in the actual experience of pleasure.

### "Dopamine detoxes" can reset your brain's reward system

The idea of a "dopamine detox" suggests that by abstaining from rewarding activities (like social media, junk food, or video games) for a period of time, you can "reset" your brain's reward system and increase your sensitivity to pleasure. However, this concept is not supported by scientific evidence.

Firstly, dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter that is involved in many essential functions, including movement, attention, and learning. Completely avoiding activities that stimulate dopamine release is not only impractical but also potentially harmful.

Secondly, the brain's reward system is a complex network of neural pathways that cannot be simply "reset" by taking a break from certain activities. While reducing excessive engagement in certain behaviors can be beneficial for mental health and well-being, the concept of a "dopamine detox" is an oversimplification of how the brain works.

Instead of attempting a "dopamine detox," it's more effective to focus on maintaining a balanced lifestyle, setting healthy boundaries around potentially addictive behaviors, and engaging in a variety of rewarding activities that promote overall well-being.

### Dopamine is only relevant for reward and addiction

While dopamine is indeed a crucial player in the brain's reward system and the development of addictions, it has a much broader range of functions. Dopamine is involved in motor control, decision-making, working memory, and even immune system regulation. Focusing solely on its role in reward can lead to an overly simplistic understanding of this complex neurotransmitter.

### More dopamine always means more happiness

Having higher levels of dopamine does not necessarily translate to increased happiness or well-being. In fact, excessively high dopamine levels can lead to agitation, anxiety, and even psychosis. Optimal dopamine function involves a delicate balance, not just maximizing dopamine at all costs.

### Dopamine is the only neurotransmitter that matters for motivation

Although dopamine is a key player in motivation and goal-directed behavior, it works in concert with other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine and glutamate. These neurotransmitters interact in complex ways to regulate motivation, arousal, and decision-making. Attributing all aspects of motivation to dopamine alone oversimplifies the intricate workings of the brain.

### You can directly increase dopamine levels through specific foods or supplements

While certain foods and nutrients (like tyrosine, an amino acid precursor to dopamine) are necessary for dopamine production, the relationship between diet and dopamine levels is not straightforward. The brain tightly regulates dopamine levels, and simply consuming "dopamine-boosting" foods or supplements does not necessarily lead to increased dopamine activity in the brain. Maintaining a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle is important, but there's no magic formula for directly manipulating dopamine levels through diet alone.

## Notes![[To7R5vco@2x.png]]



- Dopamine bridges the gap between expectaitons and expereince. If experience exceeds expectaitons, we get dopamine, if not, it doesn't
- With certain addictions, you can constantly get something going, and with technology designers do thsi on pourpouse. Link this to Tristian Harris stuff as well.
- 24 hour dopamine detox is not going to do too much.
- It helps us learn from experience and update expectations

- The chemical of what you desire.
- When we consume things, we get a good feeling at the end.
- Dopamine
	- Lots of research of addiction research done
	- This is because this is the chemical that gets you addicted to things
	- Does this mean that all drugs do the same thing? Just generate dopamine spikes in those pathways?
- Tight relationship between Dopamine and euphoria 
- This is what that part of the way --> The reward pathway
- Dopamine called the pleasure pathway
- Dopamine rewards when when we do things, that from an evolutoinary perspective, ensures that we can survive and reproduce. Good to link to Brain Meets World here.
- There is a problem
	- 
- Walking down the street, everything is the same, no dopamine spike. When you notice a brand new bakery is opened, the dopamine spikes. You try a croissant, it is great, then you come there every day. Two weeks later, you go and eat the croissant, there is no excitement. 
- When expectations go up, dopamine goes down.
- Dopamine feels good (but why is that?)
- As soon as what we hope for becomes what we have, dopamine dissappears.
- Does this mean that we are destined to always be 
- Go to more of a touch-feely 
- Dopamine cannot give you satisfaction more than a hammer can turn a screen.
- Dopamine makes the world a better place, it can also destroy us. 
- If you want to do great things, fire up your dopamine circuits
- But when you get there, you need to do something else. You need to get off your dopamine circuits, and feel the here and now circuits. Spend time in the present moment. 
- Dopamine and Addiction
	- It often pays to think about the extremes first and then go to more common examples later
	- If we are to think of what is the stimulus, what is the peak in dopamine, and what happens after the peak, things become very clear about why addictoins happens.
- If someone craves cocaine, what are they craving? Dopamine, alertness, they crave the feeling of beign on cocaine. 
- What happens, they smoke/snort cocaine, and dopamine levels almost immediately go up. The time gap is very short. There is so little time that the system learns that cocaine = massive amounts of dopamine, and this reinforces the brain circuits. 
- This then goes against the long term rewards, that can take weeks and years, do not lead to peaks in dopamine.
- This tells us something critical. it is both the duration between desire and effect (the rewarding properties of dopamine). 
- The higher the peak and faster it reaches that, the lower it drops (i..e a steep drop and deep throfts).
- There is pleasure and then lack of pleasure, but it is worse than that. The drop below baseline sets in motion a desire for more. This is one of cycles that creates addiction.
- Makes it hard to pursue things that take longer. 
- Create a table of dopamien increase from various common actions.
- The other thing that happens with big fast spikes in dopamine. It takes longer to get back to the Baseline that before taking the drug, the peaks of dopamine that come from continued cocaine are lower, and the throwts are lower and longer. System shifts from pleasure to pain
- How does this link to ADHD?
- Add somewhere about it pulsing 3-5 times per second, but can go up to 20-30 times per second when really activated. 
- Dopamine makes you happy, also makes you move
- Discuss Parkisons Diseases, it is partly a lack of dopamine 
- It's the "Make things happen" chemical 
- Pramixpexole --> Drug to replace dopamine, can target depression but also has side effects
- Have a discussoin on depression and Dopamine?
- I am still not sure if more dopamine is good.
- The more drugs push on dopamine centers, the more they wear them out, the more you have to push to get the same.

-
- Dopamine leads to tolerance
- This entire guide links to Brain Meets World. 
- Companies use dopamine and hotwire people's neurons to profit. Tech and fast food. 
	- Can dicuss the book "hooked". This video summarizes it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7fT9U3Q2-o
- Dopamine downregulates seratonin. The more pleasure you seek, the more unhappy you get. 
- Interesting, a lot of philosophy seems to have the right intuition without ever knowing about dopamine or serotonin.
- We don't understand addiction: opiod addiction statistics
	- Addicition to your phone is not the same as the adictipn to fentanyl 
	- Some goals are more important than others. You may wnat a cheeseburger, but you may not stop reading right now and go to McDonalds right now.
	- You might think that you like a cheeseburger one because you want one.
	- Brain proceses for liking and wanting things are differnet.
	- Dopamine teaches how and where to get the things that we need or we like
	- It makes us pay attention to what is important.
	- Let's less important things wait. 
	- Addictive drugs don't work the same way as burgers or iphones.
	- They go to directly to the brain
	- Make chart of Amphetamine compared to burger and other things, crazy difference. Burger might be a few seconds, morphone might be 5 hours.
	
	- You can never accurately predict how much reward you can get, this is why you can get addicted to herion or other drugs. 
	- Liking and wanting are two different things. It's not a moral failing, it's a biological.
	- Addicts want their drugs far more than we could ever imagine. It is not because they like the drug, its because the drugs are teaching the brain to seek more and more drugs —  no matter the cost. 
	- Also should include some research on cold water exposure and baseline dopamine going up?
