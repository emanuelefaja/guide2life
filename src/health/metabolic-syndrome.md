Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that include abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high triglycerides , and low [HDL cholesterol](./nutrition/fats#understanding-cholesterol), which together increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

Understanding metabolic syndrome is crucial because it is a significant risk factor for several serious and potentially life-threatening health conditions. By recognizing the cluster of conditions that make up metabolic syndrome, you can take actions to reduce your risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. 

These conditions not only impact your quality of life but also place a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide.

Most of the disorders associated with metabolic syndrome don't have obvious signs or symptoms. One sign that is visible is a large waist circumference.

Abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor for metabolic syndrome, it is not the only determining factor. 

To be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, you typically need to have at least three of the following five conditions:

1. Abdominal obesity: This is defined as a waist circumference of more than 40 inches (102 cm) in men and more than 35 inches (88 cm) in women.
2. High blood pressure: A reading of 130/85 mmHg or higher.
3. High fasting blood sugar: A level of 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or higher.
4. High triglycerides: A level of 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or higher.
5. Low HDL cholesterol: A level less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in men and less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women.
