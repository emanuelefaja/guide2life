# Pomodoro Technique.


The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique gets its name from the Italian word _"pomodoro"_ which means tomato. Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to track his work intervals, and thus the technique was born.

The Pomodoro Technique is simple yet effective. It involves breaking down your work into focused, 25-minute intervals called "pomodoros." After each pomodoro, you take a short 5-minute break. After completing four pomodoros, you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes [1]. This cycle is repeated throughout the day, helping you maintain focus and avoid burnout.

The technique works by training your brain to focus for short periods, knowing that a break is coming soon. This helps to combat procrastination and improve productivity. The regular breaks also give your mind a chance to rest and recharge, preventing mental fatigue and increasing overall efficiency.
During each 25-minute pomodoro, you focus solely on the task at hand, eliminating all distractions.[2]

This intense concentration can be likened to a form of meditation. Just as in meditation, where you focus on your breath or a mantra, the Pomodoro Technique encourages you to direct all your attention to a single task, allowing everything else to fade into the background 

By using the Pomodoro Technique consistently, you can develop better concentration skills, improve your time management, and increase your productivity. The technique has been widely adopted by students, professionals, and anyone looking to make the most of their time and minimize distractions.

To start using the Pomodoro Technique, all you need is a timer (a physical timer, like Cirillo's tomato-shaped one, or a digital app) and a task to work on. Break your task into manageable 25-minute intervals, set your timer, and get to work. 

Remember to take your short and long breaks as scheduled, and you'll soon find yourself making steady progress on even the most challenging projects.
