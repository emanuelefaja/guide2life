# The Importance of Habits.

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." 
**Aristotle.**

Regardless of your plans, you can only live one day at a time. Think about this. Everything you do, all the results you achieve, all the relationships you build, are based on your actions today. Arguably, we could shrink this down from today to this very moment. 

This is a large responsibility, and often many days go past where we don’t live in accordance with our principles. Where we end our day with regrets instead of being proud of our achievements. 

Fortunately, we can consider each new day to be an opportunity for a fresh start. 

## Creatures of Habit

Humans are creatures of habits, but it is only in the last fifty years that scientific research has understood just how true this saying is. Everything, literally, changes the shape of your brain. The brain is incredibly flexible, this is what makes human beings so adaptable to almost any situation. 

Studies show that 43% of our behaviours are driven by our habits. [^wood]

This adaptability, and the ability to create and strengthen neural networks and synaptic pathways in the brain is a double edged sword. It can work with us when we compound healthy habits, and against us when, for instance, we get addicted to Fentanyl — a drug that is 50x more potent than Heroin — and we cannot help but seek more. 

> "The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.”  **Samuel Johnson​.**



## The Point of Habits.

The idea behind developing habits is to create patterns of behavior that are easy to repeat. We move these patterns from conscious effort to something akin to unconscious behavior. To paraphrase Nike, we “just do it.”

Living a good life involves balancing numerous aspects — career, health, relationships, education, wealth, and decisions, among others. By automating routine actions through habits, we free up mental space and cognitive resources to focus on more complex and meaningful activities. This shift not only enhances productivity but also contributes to overall well-being.

When behaviors become habitual, they require less mental energy, allowing us to concentrate on tasks that demand more attention and creativity. For instance, developing healthy eating habits can reduce the mental effort needed to make daily food choices, leaving more room for professional and personal growth. Similarly, establishing a regular exercise routine can improve physical health without requiring constant conscious motivation.

Moreover, habits provide a sense of stability and structure in our lives. They help us navigate the uncertainties and complexities of daily living by offering a predictable framework. Good habits can lead to incremental improvements over time, fostering a growth mindset and continuous self-improvement.

Additionally, habits enable us to spend less time on self-improvement and more time enjoying life. By embedding beneficial behaviors into our daily routines, we achieve a state where these actions are performed with minimal effort, leading to a more efficient and fulfilling life. Life is meant to be lived, and effective habits help us streamline necessary tasks, allowing us to savor more moments and experiences that make life truly meaningful.
