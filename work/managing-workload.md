# Managing Workload

- There is this idea that more = better
- The amount of workload will dramatically effect life quality
- There will always be too much to do
- This should link to Stress page and Remote Work page and perhaps Cortisol page
- Knowledge work (reference is Slow Productivity) 
	- Any new commitment will generate administrative overhead and meta-work. Work about work, or overhead tax.
	- As your list of to-do list grows, so does your overhead tax.
	- Ad verbatim
		- The workday is fixed, so administrative chores will take more and more tiem away from your core work, slowing down the rate at which these objecgives are accomplished 
		- Moderate workloads: this is frustrating. General sense that things should take longer than they should
		- heavy Workload: meta work completely takes over, and there is nothing else left! 
			- You cannot complete old tasks fast enough as new tasks start coming in; This feedback loop and quickly spiral out of control pushing your workload higher and higher untoly uo find yourself losing your entire day to overhead (metawork) activities. Meeting after meeting, all-day-hat, and unceasing email. The only solution is to put real work into specific sessions added in after hours. 
- Define Metawork
- AI does not really help --> Working with AI means that you get more done, and then more gets added to your plate
- Replying to email quickly means you get more emails back. 
- Solutions?
	- Say no
		- Delay
	- Delegate
	- Take shortcuts
	- Perfectionism 


* Focus on single topic at a time  
* Find large blocks of time to work on it  
* Don't rush as things take time, slow steady progress
